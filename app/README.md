# Everything Web Project 2: Lifely - Part-Up App Optimizations
This readme contains documentation on the optimizations and add-ons that I worked on for Project 2.

## The assignment
Analyse the application and use your knowledge gained in the past 3 weeks to find bugs, semantic errors, unoptimized assets etc. and improve the application with any enhancement you'd like, provided it truly enhances the application.

### Project outline
* Checkout a repository
* Get the development environment running
* Get completely overwhelmed
* Not give up, push through
* Pick or create a story
* Develop
* Push a pullrequest
* Pat yourself on the back ðŸ‘Š

### Part-up tech stack
* Back-end: MeteorJS
* Build tool: MeteorJS
* Front-end: MeteorJS
* Development: MeteorJS
* Deployment: Ansible / Docker / Jenkins

## What I worked on
At first I set out to optimize the application by compressing all assets, including CSS/JS, create critical CSS and async loading of scripts and assets.

It turned out that many of my co-students worked on this same issue, therefore I decided to work on Service Workers, some UX improvements and branding (native app banners).

### Service Worker
The service worker has been implemented succesfully.
